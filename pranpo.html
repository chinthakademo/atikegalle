				&nbsp;&nbsp;Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the personal data our processes, how we processes it, and for what 
					purposes.
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;We offers a wide range of products, including server products used to help operate enterprises worldwide, devices you use in your 
					home, software that students use at school, and services developers use to create and host what’s next. References to our products 
					in this statement include our service, websites, apps, software, servers, and devices.
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Please read the product-specific details in this privacy statement, which provide additional relevant information. This statement 
					applies to the interactions ATI Kegalle has with you and the our products listed below, as well as other ATI Kegalle that display this 
					statement.
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people may prefer starting with the Privacy for young people page. That page highlights information that may be helpful for 
					young people.
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;We collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and
					we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends 
					on the context of your interactions with ati kegalle and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products 
					and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;If you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise and Developer Products from SLIATE, please 
					see the teachers and students products section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data. If you are an end user 
					of a ATI Kegalle or a SLIATE account provided by your usage, please see the Products provided by your purpose and the SLIATE account
					sections for more information.
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can
					decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required 
					to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data 
					by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the 
					contract; 
					or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case 
					at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use
					such data will not work for you.
